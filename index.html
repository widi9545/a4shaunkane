	<h2> Starting My Week Via Concussion </h1>
		<p> On Monday, I was walking into work when I decided to fall on a patch of ice. "Decided" might be a bit of a strong term
			more like the ice decided for me.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I went into work and was mostly doing okay until about 11, when I started feeling like everything was in slow motion and I couldn't really think. </p>
	<p> I decided that I would leave, and tried to make a doctors appointment. I hadn't established care at my primary care physician yet, so I couldn't make an appointment </p>
	<p> This resulted in me needing to go the hospital, because from my symptoms, my nurse said that I really did need to be checked out that day. </p>
