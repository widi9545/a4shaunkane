	<h2> Starting My Week Via Concussion </h1>
		<p> On Monday, I was walking into work when I decided to fall on a patch of ice. "Decided" might be a bit of a strong term
			more like the ice decided for me.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I went into work and was mostly doing okay until about 11, when I started feeling like everything was in slow motion and I couldn't really think. </p>
	<p> I decided that I would leave, and tried to make a doctors appointment. I hadn't established care at my primary care physician yet, so I couldn't make an appointment </p>
	<p> This resulted in me needing to go the hospital, because from my symptoms, my nurse said that I really did need to be checked out that day. </p>
	<p> I had some trouble deciding which hospital to go to because I literally could not think, and I wasn't sure what was in my plan. I ended up texting Lexi and she (as always) was a major, major help to me and figured out which Hospital in Boulder that I could go to. </p>	
	<p> After I got into the hospital, they gave me a CT scan, however thankfully, the results came back negative, and I wasn't suffering any brain bleeding or anything serious. </p>
	<p> The doctor did tell me that I was suffering from a pretty bad concussion, and told me to take it easy (which I tried to ignore as best I could) </p>
	<p> Here is a picture of me in the hospital! </p>

	<h2> What can/can't I do when suffering from a concussion </h2>
		<p> I can't: exercise, drink, watch movies, look at screens, read books, do homework, learn, concentrate, and had a hard time eating. </p>
